Goodreads — HIG Redesign (SwiftUI)
A clean and minimal Goodreads redesign built to study and apply the Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) while practicing SwiftUI development.

Overview
The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of the HIG.
Together with my mentor, I selected Goodreads because the “My Books” view often feels cluttered and overwhelming.
I deconstructed the app, examined Apple’s Books and Podcasts apps, and rebuilt the main views in SwiftUI with a simpler, more focused structure.

Features
- Custom HIG-aligned app icon
- Custom splash screen
- Redesigned My Books view (with lists)
- Books Detail View (push navigation)
- Navigation Bar + Tab Bar following HIG
- Redesigned Home (with cards)
- Redesigned Discovery (with lists)
- Search button
- UI elements like: chevron “See All”, favourite, ellipsis, stars rating
- Minimal UI focused only on essential features

Presentation
I created a 55-slide Keynote presentation, designed as a story based on feedback from my first challenge.
It includes:
- Deconstructed Goodreads screenshots
- Screenshots of my redesigned views
- Animations and GIFs for a more engaging experience
I also challenged myself to work primarily in Keynote instead of Figma, though I used some Figma tools for assets.
