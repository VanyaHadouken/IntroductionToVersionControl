My main goal was to learn more about the HIG. Together with my mentor Roberta, I searched for a app that can help me to reach my goal. 
I chose Goodreads cause in "My Books" view I always feel a bit overwhelmed by too many buttons.
Starting from this I deconstructed the app but also searched for other references taking a look to "Book" and "Podcast" apps.
After coding "My Books" view and linking the push action with a detail view I started to learn more about HIG and coding.
So I decided to code also a Navigation bar, a Tab bar, "Home" (with cards) and "Discovery" (with lists) views, a search button but also other buttons such as chevron see all, favourite, ellipsis, exc.
After that I created another icon according to HIG (cause the official Goodreads one is a letter) and added it also as a splash screen.
My version of Goodreads is a very clean, minimal app with only the features that I think are really useful inside.
Then I made my slides using Keybote. Starting from feedbacks of the 1st challenge, I made this presentation more as a story, talking about what I learned from the 1st challenge and what i want to improve.
Inside the slides you can find some deconstruced Goodreads app screenshots but also screenshot from my app.
I also forced myself to work using Keynote and not Figma (I used some features of Figma by the way) and made 55 slides. They are so many cause I added animation, gifs and things like that to make the experience more enjoyable for the audience.
